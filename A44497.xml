            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>een far better ſpoken to, or in which
<pb facs="tcp:32635:3"/>there may be nothing wrong, though my weakneſs happily perceive not wherein. Nor can I think, that the World is grown ſo good and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo void of its enmity to God, and his goodneſs, as that there are none in it who will pick quarrels againſt what is rightly done. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the Greatneſs of the things treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; as the perſon and works of Chriſt; the nature of the Truth: the Faith, Hope, and Obedience of the Goſpel, the terrours of the Lord againſt evil doers, the Purpoſes, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and Operations of God, are all of that nature, and height, and weight, that each of them may deſerve a Volume worthily to unfold them, and require a far more able head, and heart, to diſcuſs them, then mine be; and more labour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, than I have beſtowed, or was able to beſtow about them: and on the other ſide, that ſuch is my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of exerciſe of ſenſes, to diſcern things that differ, and of judgment rightly, and orderly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, that I may ſeem not to have followed the advice of <hi>Socrates,</hi> given a little after the ſayings above reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:32635:3"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Either to undertake ſuch things as one can grapple with, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear things that one cannot. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may fear, that men of greater underſtandings, will find ſome things defective, and not ſufficiently ſpoken to, and cleared; and other things too often repeated, or too unorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned. I am a man (and a weak one too,) and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally think it ſtrange, that humane Infirmities ſhould be incident to me; amongſt which, it is one to be ſubject to miſtakes; even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an <hi>Homer,</hi> as the Proverb ſays, <hi>may catch a nap;</hi> and acute <hi>Bernard, yet ſees not all things:</hi> no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in a long and tedious buſineſs, to ſee one grow drouſie, and ſometimes to nod; beſides, the Truth lies as it were in the deep, and is not ſo eaſily brought to Light. I hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Ingenuous Readers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>That in many things we offend all.</hi> Will be ready alſo to take his advice, <hi>not to be many Maſters;</hi> that is, not to be cenſorious, but will take in good part, what I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and performed, and will bear
<pb facs="tcp:32635:4"/>with the infirmities of my ſtile, and manner of tractation, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick from the matters handled. But from two ſorts of men, I can expect no ſuch candid dealing: that is to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The proud and rich in conceit of themſelves, and their Learning; and ſuch as are ſeeking after the worldly Wiſdome: they I know will find no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in what I have written, becauſe nothing to ſatisfie their curioſity, and pleaſe the daintineſs of their finer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; they will ſlight what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becauſe I have not ſtrewed the way of my Diſcourſe, with the flowers of quaint and ſmooth Rhetorications, elegant Phraſes, and apt and witty Alluſions; nor fenced it with the Teſtimonies of the Ancient Doctors, and Learned Writers: nor given the Reader here and there the comfit of a pleaſant ſtory, to quicken up his dull and tired Spirits, and keep him from fainting: in a word, they will ſay, <hi>Here is neither Artifice, nor any polite learning;</hi> the things they look for, with the Ancient <hi>Grecians.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. To whom I ſay, had it been my deſign to hunt after applauſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:32635:4"/>had been my direct courſe to it:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Populo ut place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quas fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſet fabulas Terent.</hi>
               </note> eſpecially, had I turned aſide from the Truth, to witty fables, for they are the things the people are too uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pleaſed with: Yea, had I ſought honour with the Leaders of this Age, my way had been to have quitted the Truth, and ſhewed my ſelf able to maintain the Ortho-Doct Opinions: or at leaſt, to have adorned my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a rich Coat; for then it may be, ſo accouter'd, it might have taken ſome mens more wanton affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who would have courted it, not for the Truth, ſo much as for its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, (like ſome that love the perſon, for the gay clothing;) and ſo they might have given me their good word for a Scholar, or man of Parts: though yet ſome are ſo capricious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their diſlike of the Truth, that nothing will pleaſe them, that is hearty for the Truth; be it never ſo Elegant, but even a Cyprian ſhall in contempt be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricianus</hi> with them, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> writes. But my deſign being to find out, and ſet forth the Truth; and that for the helpfulneſs and profit of many, and they of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:32635:5"/>capacities, and not for the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely. I took it to be beſt, to be plain; as believing that the Truth is then moſt beautiful to a chaſt Eye, when it is moſt naked of humane varniſhing; and that they that like not the Truth, but in a curious dreſs, love not the Truth but the Dreſs. 'Tis <hi>Origens</hi> obſervation too,
<note place="margin">Orig. <hi>contr.</hi> Celſ <hi>lib.</hi> 6.</note> that the ordinary way of Expreſſion, which is common and plain, is the likelieſt way to profit the moſt. And that <hi>Plato</hi>'s and other Philoſophers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Elegant and exquiſite way of ſpeaking, profited but a few, when as the ſimplicity of the holy men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themſelves to vulgar capacity both in their Doctrine, and way of delivering it, did profit very many. Thence <hi>Epictetus</hi> hath more Readers than <hi>Plato,</hi> becauſe of his plainneſs, and as that Phyſitian is moſt to be eſteemed, that prepares meats wholeſome, and Medicinable, for the moſt; and not he that prepares only ſome more curious Compoſitions that are fit for none but the delicate Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; (it's his compariſon too:) So are they amongſt the Souls Phyſitians moſt to be regarded, that by plainer,
<pb facs="tcp:32635:5"/>and ſimpler Teaching, ſeek to Edify the Multitude, rather then by pleaſing the Palates, of a few that ſeek after wiſdom of Words to affect, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their own admiration. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though I am not free from ſuch youthful Luſts of ſhewing Wit and Learning (if I had them,) which (with the reſt of them) the man of God is to flee from, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. Yet I cannot forget the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; That the Wiſdome of Words though it procure Applauſe to the Preacher, yet is unprofitable to the hearer, becauſe it makes the Croſs of Chriſt of no effect to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. While inſtead of drawing his heart to Chriſt, and his love, it is loſt by the way in the Preachers Learning: and while in ſtead of Killing, and Crucifying the Affections of the Fleſh, which are naturally alive to things of that nature, it doth more animate and inflame them. Well, I have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what God hath brought to my hand: and though I have done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as plain <hi>Jacob</hi> at his Mothers advice, taken what I found in the Flock near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er home, prepared by Free-grace the Mother of the Faithful: yet I hope,
<pb facs="tcp:32635:6"/>it will meet with our Fathers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obtain <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Bleſſing; which I eſteem far better, than if I ſhould have loſt it by hunting more ſubtly about with <hi>Eſau</hi> for more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Veniſon that the ſickly Palate might have found more reliſh in. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They alſo who ſeek a Sign will not like the Doctrine this Treatiſe delivers, but it will prove an offence unto them. I mean, they that believe not the love of God to all men, as teſtifyed in the Croſs of Chriſt, and declared in the Scriptures to them; that like not to have the ground of their Faith in Gods plain Aſſertions, nor to have their hope ſpring from, and be fed by, that which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Fleſh of Chriſt given for the life of the World: but are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as dry <hi>Manna,</hi> or unſound Doctrine; and are ſeeking ſome more appropriate bottom for their Faith, which they may have rejoycing in themſelves from, and may ſerve a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proud deſire of conceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome-bodies in themſelves, or more perſonally, and as out of Chriſt reſpected then other men, that ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:32635:6"/>
               <hi>Stolen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant.</hi> Some private perſonal ground of hoping in God, to be preferred before what is ſet on Wiſdomes Table, for all to come and feed on. Theſe will ſome of them be more ſeriouſly offended, and caſt out my Name, as they have done, amongſt the Evil Doers; the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of corrupt and unwholſom Doctrine: becauſe the grace of God to All, throws down their impropriate Incloſures, and ſpoils the pride of their Self-rejoycing; whom I ſhall not ſeek to ſatisfie, but ſhall ſay, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſo to go, as the Truth may be my leader, and companion:</hi> And becauſe I find it ſaid, <hi>God is good to All.</hi> I dare not think him otherwiſe to any; tho true it is, That moſt be bad to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and abuſe his goodneſs, to their own Deſtruction. Though yet to take away prejudice from the more ſober minded, that differ from me, I have I hope, come as neer them in Expreſſion too, as the Truth would lead me.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Conclude, with ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

If he ſay, This is not well ſaid, becauſe I do not underſtand it, let him fault my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not my Faith. And poſſibly it might have been more truly expreſt, but none ever ſo ſpake, as that in all things he could be underſtood by All. If there be any that ſay, the ſame things more plainly, let him lay me aſide, and read what he can better underſtand: yet let him not conclude, that I ſhould have been ſilent, becauſe I expreſs not my ſelf ſo well as thoſe, he better underſtands: for all things written by all, come not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every mans hands; and ſome may underſtand theſe things, who may not meet with what thou better underſtandeſt, and therefore it is good, that divers write of the ſame queſtions, in a diverſe ſtile, though not in a different Faith, that the Truth may come to many; to ſome this way, and to others otherwiſe. But if he that complains, that he underſtands not theſe things, never could underſtand

But if he that reads theſe things ſay, I underſtand what is ſaid, but it is not Truth that is ſaid, or it is not truly ſaid; let him if he pleaſe deliver his own mind, and reprove mine if he can, which if he ſhall do with charity and verity, and acquaint me with it, if I live, I ſhall then be a gainer by this my labour, but if he cannot do it to me, let him do it with my good leave, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to whom he may, I ſhall yet medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the Law of God, if not day and night, yet at what times I can. I fear not to deliver mine Opinion, which I rather deſire ſhould be look'd into by thoſe that are right, then I fear to be bitten by thoſe that are perverſe,

And the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their next and remote power:) So by not diſtinguiſhing things that do indeed differ, and that too according to the difference between them: others do run into many, no leſs miſtakes, and great confuſions; as they that diſtinguiſh not between Chriſts coming in the weakneſs of the Fleſh, or his Spiritual manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of himſelf to mens hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and his coming again Perſonally in the Power and Glory of God.

                  <p>Amongſt other things, I have often thought the Right Diſtinguiſhing between
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32635:22"/>the Doctrine or Truth-praedicable, or to be Preached to the World, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by them, for bringing them to God: and the purpoſes and diſpenſations of God reſpecting the ſaid Truth, and his operations in, and with it, might be of good uſe, if well and rightly explicated. For I apprehend, that the moſt material differences between thoſe commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Remonſtrants, Arminians,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and thoſe that ſtile themſelves, and one another, the <hi>Contra Remonſtrants:</hi> and Orthodox do mainly ſpring from a want of duly diſtinguiſhing the ſaid particulars, and of right apprehenſions about them; and by conſequence, that the right diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between them, and right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of them, would expedite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver either the one, or the other, or both of them from ſuch miſtakes as cauſe and maintain the ſaid differences; and tend much to an happy accommodation and agreement in the Truth. It being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſual thing with them, to argue either the Truth and extent of Gods love to, and Chriſts Death for men; from their apprehenſions of the ſaid Diſpenſations, Purpoſes, and Operations in the ſaid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction conſiderable, and to meaſure the former by the latter: or on the contrary, to meaſure the latter by the former, and argue them therefrom; which though righter than the other, yet ought not but with good adviſement to be done.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Doctrine to be Preached to men, its independency upon mens Knowledge and Faith of it; its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in it ſelf, and Truth for all men.</hi>

                  <p>THe Doctrine to be preached to, and to be received by men in the Truth of God, or his Word, which is but one in it ſelf for all, true in it ſelf, and ſo fit to be declared to, and believed by all; whether they do actually know it or not, believe it or not. Its Truth and fitneſs to be Preached to them, and believed by them, depend not upon the Preaching and Believing of it, but is Praecedaneous to, and in order of Nature and time before them. For it is not therefore true, becauſe declared; or falſe, becauſe not: but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its fit to be declared, and may as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and given forth be declared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its true: as therefore alſo its meet to be believed, when, where, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32635:23"/>and not therefore true, or untrue, becauſe it is believed, or rejected: even as a thing is not, therefore viſible, becauſe it is ſeen; but becauſe its viſible, therefore it may be ſeen. Indeed the benefit the Doctrine brings to men, and good its apt to effect in the believing heart, is not effected or met with where rejected: yet it is a Doctrine worthy to be believed, and apt to effect ſuch good, before it be known, or believe: or whether it be known and believed, or not. I ſay, it hath an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal aptitude in it ſelf to do good inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently upon its being known, (or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; though it cannot actually produce thoſe effects but by being known,) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Even as a good Plaiſter hath in it ſelf an aptitude to heal, whether it be applied or no; although it cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally heal unleſs applyed: It gets no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by its application, but the Sore to which it's applyed, gets vertue from it to the healing it; which if not applyed, it could not have had from it.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine alſo is but one in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to, or for All: not one to one, and another, to another; but the ſame Truth of God, and Object of Divine Faith, which holds forth the ground of Mens believing, and Object to be believed on, is one and the ſame for All; though this our Truth hath in it many particular bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Contents, and all of this one Truth hath not been revealed at once to All; nor ſo much of it to one, as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32635:24"/>nor to ſome at all: yet the ſame is revealable in it ſelf to all, and true for All. Though this our Truth hath not been at all times ſo much revealed, or in ſuch form as in ſome: as not ſo much, nor in ſuch form before Chriſts appearing in the Fleſh, Suffering for us, and Aſcention from us, as ſince; as to ſay. It was not true then, nor might be ſo affirmed, That Jeſus Chriſt was already born of a Virgin, had dyed, and roſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which is true now, and truly declared as done, was then true, and might have been declared in the future, That it ſhould in due time be done, whether it was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, or not; yea, it was true then, that it was accepted by Chriſt, to do, and ſuffer, as in due time he hath; and it was with God as virtually, though not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done.</p>

                  <p>FRom what hath been conſidered, we may gather theſe Two Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Independency of the Truth or Doctrine of God upon mens Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and Faith of it, it follows; That it is no valid or ſound Conſequence for men to argue, becauſe the <hi>Heathen</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32635:24"/>had not, or in ſome parts have not the things of Chriſt Publiſhed to them; and ſo had, or have not the Knowledg, or Faith of them, therefore they are not true; for, or concerning them: as that God ſent Chriſt into the World to be the Saviour of them, and that Chriſt hath now Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dyed for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seeing the truth of theſe things depend not upon their knowing, or believing them no more than that they were made Righteous in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſinned, and fell in him: or that Chriſt is Lord over them, and ſhall raiſe, and Judge them: which are no more declared to them, and known, and believed by them, then the other; no more than that God loves no Infants, or that Chriſt Dyed for, or is the Saviour of none of them that die in Infancy, becauſe they have not the Knowledge, and Faith of theſe things on this ſide Death: and what we ſay of <hi>Heathens</hi> may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idiots, and perſons born Deaf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be ſaid probably, that they have not that good and comfort in their hearts that properly ſpring from the faith and knowledge of theſe Truths, (unleſs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inward Revelation,) and yet neither can we ſay, they can have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by thoſe things truly aſſerted to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: ſeeing benefit by them to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may accrue to perſons; (I ſay, not that reject the knowledge and faith of them when afforded, or neglected to ſeek them, having opportunity thereto; but)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32635:25"/>that by the All-wiſe Providence of God, are deprived of them; as is plain in the caſe of Infants, which have both evil and good, by what they never had any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for the Knowledge and Faith of: that is, the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Death of Chriſt for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Unity of the Doctrine, and its Truth, though under different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and forms of Expreſſion; and the vertuous being of the things with God as ſure to be done in time, which in former Ages were not actually done; it follows alſo, That it's no true, or good conſequence to ſay, Becauſe ſome were actually Dead, and in Hell, before Chriſts Incarnation, and Suffering; therefore Chriſt was not Incarnate, or Dyed not for them. That he Dyed not for them as in Hell may probably be ſaid; but not that he dyed not for them, as perſons ſometimes living on the Earth, capable of the Truths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared to, and received by them: ſeeing they had the ſame Truth in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance declarable, or declared to them, as a thing to be done in its time, that we have now declared to us, as a thing already done; but if it was in their days true, That God was ſo affected towards them, as to appoint his Son, in due time to ſuffer for them; then was it alſo certainly in its time performed for them, what ever in the mean time became of them: even as it was true for them that were actually Saved, and in Paradiſe, or <hi>Abraham's</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32635:25"/>before Chriſt came; that Chriſt when he came, ſhould Dye for them; not as Saved perſons, and then in Heaven, but as Sinners in their day, that needed his Death for their Salvation; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in due time he did ſuffer for them. The Saved, being ſaved through, and in belief of, and obedience to the ſame Truth and Grace, for the contempt of, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to, which the Damned were Condemned: and the Damned Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Contempt of the ſame, by which the Believer was Saved. But let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to a more full and particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſaid Doctrine, and ſee what it is, and what is in it.</p>

                     <hi>Jacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and he lived but one hundred thirty three years; and <hi>Amram Kohath</hi>'s Son, and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Father lived but one hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeven years, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was but 80 years old at their departure thence, all which ſumms put together make but 350 years; though <hi>Kohath</hi> ſhould beget <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> in the laſt year of his life; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Amram Moſes</hi> in his laſt, which is not probable.

                  <p>The Summ and Concluſion of this Chapter is, That though the Truth of God, in it ſelf practicable to men, be but one and the ſame; yet the Revelations, Manife-ſtations, and Diſpenſations of it have been very divers and different; ſome Perſons have had nothing of it as to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and perception knowable to us, as Infants dying in Infancy; ſome have had only ſome darker ſignifications of ſome things of it by the Works and Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, as many of the Heathen; ſome have alſo had ſome rumour of the words of God revealed to, and in his Churches, and opportunities to ſeek it out

                  <p n="1">1.

Thence the Scripture alſo repreſents the believing Man, or Man called of God, as a third perſon between two others, calling for

If the man yield up to the Fleſh, it becomes his Maſter, and He its ſervant framed more into its mind; and if the man through the grace of God yield up himſelf to the Spirit, then the Spirit in and by him as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter works the works of God; creates him in Chriſt Jeſus to good works, and renews him more and more by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and influence, as is to be ſeen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11.12, 13, 14. &amp;c. and 8.2.4.12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16.17, 18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17, 18.20, 21.

And ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That conceit cannot ſtand with the Apoſtles ſcope in writing, nor the things implyed therein, nor with other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſions. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If God ſo work the to will, and the to do or to be Operative as neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to include the whole working out exhorted to, then was there no need for <hi>Paul</hi> to take any care about it, either that they might be blameleſs or harmleſs; or that they might ſhine as lights, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the word of life: or leaſt he ſhould run in vain, or labour in vain, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them (which ſeems to be this ſcope in thus writing to them, and exhorting them, to lead and help them forward to ſuch blameleſneſs, and that he might have fruit in his labours for them) for none of thoſe things he exhorts to or mentions, as the end of that his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation could poſſibly be wanting in them, if God ſo wrought in them the to will, and the to do as neceſſarily to effect the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> nor could the thing he would not have happen come to paſs, except God
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:32635:221"/>ſhould ceaſe working in them, and in that caſe, all his care and writing could do them no good, nor contribute any the leaſt furtherance to them: nor could they poſſibly provoke God to leave them, and withdraw from them his working in them: foraſmuch as during the time of his working in them, the to will, and the to do; they muſt, according to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, both will, and do, and work out their Salvation; and ſo there could be nothing to diſpleaſe him, except the very inhaerency of corruption in them, and its proper luſtings againſt him, and his grace; which yet, while God ſo works, could not hinder God's ſo working; and ſo by conſequence, not their working out, he working that alſo effectually, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily in his working in them. And therefore why ſhould it, or how can it be conceived it ſhould move him to ceaſe his working in them? Seeing alſo that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes it not to men that Sin, is in them, and wars againſt them; or what they do by meer force of that; ſo as it is not they, but Sin that dwels in them; as is implyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16, 17, 20. and 8.1, 2. Nay, then the Apoſtles Exhortation to them had been needleſs, ſeeing they could not do otherwiſe, though he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, it being ſuppoſed. That God did work in them, the to will, and the to do, what his grace believed moved them to, before this Epiſtle came to them much leſs ſhould he have exhorted them;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:32635:222"/>To have wrought out their Salvation with fear and trembling; and that upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that God works in them to will, and do; if his ſo working in them contain in it, and neceſſarily include their working out their own Salvation. For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In ſo exhorting them, there is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, both that there was ſomething for them to do, which they had liberty, and power given them to do, and which was needful for them to do; and alſo, that there was ſome poſſibility, either by not doing it, or by not doing it ſo, as they ought; they might provoke God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt them, and ſo to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his workings in them: Why elſe ſhould they work out their Salvation with fear and trembling. But if God's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them to will and do; do include, and contain within his proper operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their very working out to; then is there nothing for them to be exhorted to; the ground of the Exhortation contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, the matter exhorted to: much leſs could there be any room for fear or trembling, leaſt they ſhould grieve him: the poſſibility of that, being taken away by the manner of God's working in them, according to that conception; he ſhould according to that have rather ſaid, Ye muſt work it out, and cannot but work with much aſſurance, and rejoycing; yea, without all fear of any poſſibility of offending.</p>

Where the Apoſtle plainly implys, That God by his Grace, ſo takes away the Dominion of Sin, where his grace is not put away; that ſin cannot command and inforce obedience from men; but yet neither doth it ſo neceſſitate obedience to it ſelf, and the reſiſtance of Sin, but that its yet in mens power, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding grace, and ſo Gods working in them, to will, and to do;) to yeild their members to Sin, which is alſo work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, and being yeilded to, by them will work in them, to will and to do, what they ought not: yea, and by ſo yeilding their Members to it, they become ſubject to it, and give it dominion or rule over them; and it is put upon them, as ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and furniſhed by grace, to reſiſt Sin, and not to yield to it: whence ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly luſts, have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them: If ye walk after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye mortifie the Deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> &amp;c. Which all imply, the workings of God in the Believer, to be ſuch as do not ſo take in, and neceſſitate mens working, but that they may poſſibly Sin

So it is with the Believer, God works in him the to will, and the to do, in his liſtening to him, and in his ſtrength, and furniture of grace given, he may mortify Sin, and not let it reign in his mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet this grace doth not work ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſively, and irreſiſtibly, or ſo to inforce, and work his obedience to it, as that he cannot neglect it; and by neglecting it, confederate with Sin, and provoke God to withdraw himſelf, and leave him to Sins Dominion. God indeed gives more grace; yea, more than there is naturally power in envy, or other luſts, in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, to make us ſerve them; ſuch as by which we might deny them ſervice, and reſiſt them; yea mortifie, and keep them under, though not be without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation from them, as we would; and therefore God faults and reſiſts men that yet lift up themſelves, and will ſerve their proud, or envious humours, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7. So that it ſeems, notwithſtanding more grace given them, men may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly yield themſelves ſervants to their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, that have leſs power in them, to enforce their obedience: yea, and thats' the reaſon God is diſpleaſed with men, that they ſerve them; was there not more power in God's grace to help them againſt them, then in their corruptions, to inſlave them; they would not be ſo obnoxious to, or worthy of Wrath from God; but rather would be pitied, and helped by
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:32635:224"/>him: except where having put away more grace, they are inſlaved again by their Corruption, God withdrawing from them. But if God ſo wrought in men, their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and doings as in the Conception at firſt mentioned, there could be no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of any believer to fail of doing God's will, but by God's meer voluntary firſt-leaving him; no poſſibility of letting Sin have dominion over them, or grieving the Spirit; and ſo neither ground, or need of any of theſe, or the like Exhortations.</p>

And if it ſhould be his good pleaſure to ceaſe working in them without their provoking him to it (as to it they could not by that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation provoke him) then was it not poſſible that they ſhould work out their Salvation, much leſs upon the ground propounded by the Apoſtle, the truth thereof then failing and without that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

We deny not but that what ever God will work and effect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely engaging thereto his omnipotency and power to effect it, be it in men or about men, it ſhall not, nor can be let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The things that fall under his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decrees, and in and to which he is reſolved to ingage his omnipotency ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, there is no letting or hindring thereof; but that I deny to be the way of Gods working by his grace and truth, ordinarily in Men: but upon condition, by the failings or obſtinancy rather of men in not yielding to which, that which God conditionally offered to work, and that he was in ſuch ways working may be and often is hindred, and men become as veſſels broken upon the wheel, as God is framing or working of them, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.3, 4. he prevents with grace, and moves and excites men to hear and liſten to him, and in ſo doing would work in them all his good work, and in that way he would ſo work too as none ſhould let him; as he wrought ſo upon <hi>Naaman</hi> in his waſhing in <hi>Jordan:</hi> but men may (and often do) not hear nor liſten to him, or having begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they abide not therein, but turn away from him; and ſo by obſerving lying vanities forſake their own mercies, as is
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:32635:232"/>evident, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where God bids them, having ſet them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, open their mouths wide and he would fill them; in which he was moving them to liſten to him, but they refuſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived themſelves of what he would have done for them; for he would (he ſays) have ſubdued their enemies and ſed them with the fineſt of the Wheat, had they hearkened to him; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not hearken, they had not effected for and in them; ſo in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.11. he ſays, he had cauſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to cleave to him as the girdle cleaves to the loyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:32635:233"/>God to the ſalvation of thoſe that believe or credit it; and to the making them free and willing to ſerve him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and ſo in the day of his armies and companies going forth to propagate his Name and fight the good fight of Faith, his people, thoſe that ſtand on his ſide and for him offer themſelves freely. Nay further, it's granted, that no man makes himſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve Chriſt, but they that come to him; his people are made free by his power working in his Goſpel publiſhed to them, his truth ſet before them and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by them, as in that of <hi>John</hi> 8.30, 31, 32. <hi>If ye continue in my words,</hi> (that is, hearing and receiving or minding them) <hi>then are ye my diſciples</hi> (that is, his people) <hi>indeed; and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free:</hi> (ſet you at liberty from the love of ſin and the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſerve and walk with God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, and ſo offer up your ſelves free-will offerings to God.)

But here again, Men mind not that they ſwerve from the Apoſtles ſcope and buſineſs, and wreſt or carry his words from the thing he treats about: which is not of mens hearing the Word of God, and giving heed to him in the means of Grace, (though that alſo is of God) but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers difference in their gifts and receipts of Gifts from God; by occaſion of which ſome were apt to be puffed up above others; and ſome for one, who had greater Gifts, againſt another, who had leſs, as appears clearly in the former Verſe. To theſe he ſaith, even to them who had more excellent Gifts, Who made thee to differ or excel? What haſt thou? What Gift or Excellency, that thy Brother hath not, which thou haſt not received? And if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou then boaſt or pride thy ſelf of it, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it to thy ſelf, and lifting up thy ſelf above thy brother by it? This is clearly and evidently the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place; which being kept to, we cannot err by occaſion of his words. But if we will take his words and carry them from their ſcope, we may perchance through our reaſon fall into miſtakes; as if we ſhould thence argue, that we have no cauſe or ground any of us to commend one mans diligence in the uſe of his talent, and fault another mans ſlothfulneſs; or that the ſlothful ought in like manner to be excuſed or not blamed
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:32635:235"/>as the other that hath leſs Gifts, though diligent in them; becauſe as the one mans leſs Gifts proceed from God's good pleaſure to give him leſs, (as but two talents when another hath five) ſo the other mans ſlothfulneſs in like manner proceeded from God's good pleaſure too, that pleaſed not to give him ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as another hath. Surely he that minds the Scriptures, would ſee ſuch an uſe of thoſe words as ſo to argue from them to be but an abuſe of them. And ſo If we ſhould thence conclude, that God made <hi>Adam</hi> to differ from himſelf by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from his created innocency; or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there had been another man every way as perfect as <hi>Adam,</hi> and no more free and able to ſtand than <hi>Adam,</hi> and every way alike tempted and aſſiſted as he, muſt he needs have fallen as <hi>Adam</hi> did? if ſo, then how had <hi>Adam</hi> power to have ſtood? and how was his fall meerly wilful and voluntary? nay how can it be looked upon otherwiſe than as neceſſitated by defect of Grace on God's part, or by his providence ordering a temptation to him above his ſtrength, and againſt which he could not ſtand? which would certainly involve God as the neceſſary cauſe of his ſinning, and much take off from the clear equity of his Juſtice in ſo ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and us in him. But if we ſay ſuch a man, ſo ſuppoſed, might by the ſame Grace that <hi>Adam</hi> had have ſtood, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:32635:235"/>that caſe had made the difference, the one ſtanding, and the other falling, had it not been meerly <hi>Adam</hi> abuſing the Grace given and liſtening to the tempter that ſhould have made himſelf differ both from the other and from what himſelf was before? It ſeems clear to me too, that men in the ſame ſtate may act differently, and in their different acting God may make the better acter differ in his ſtate: As of two men equally wounded, and equally every way aſſiſted and furniſhed, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to look to the brazen Serpent, the one might do better than the other; as ſuppoſe by the ſame power, that one abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed running from the brazen Serpent, the other yielding to the ſame motive and motion afforded to both might have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, and then the brazen Serpent, or God in and by it might make the difference between them as to their ſtate, healing the looker to it, when as the other run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away was not healed: without which healing act of God their different actings had done nothing to the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one from the other as to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Sure it's better walking in God's way, than in our own: for in God's way we may expect to find God making us to differ both from our ſelves and others that refuſe his way to walk in their own, though yet neither can we walk in God's way, the uſe of his means in any right manner, without his preventing Grace inabling a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:32635:236"/>Grace helping us therein.</p>
                  <p>As for the other part of the collection that men receive from God their doing better, the Scripture mentioned gives no ground for it, becauſe it ſays not, <hi>What dost thou, that thou hast not received;</hi> though in a ſound ſenſe, ſpeaking of good actions, it may be truly ſo ſaid, according to that in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> before ſpoken to. It is God that worketh in you to will and to do; the ſtrength, vertue, power, motive, motion to do what is good, and aſſiſtance in doing it we have from God, without which we could not do it; yet ſo as it may be mans voluntary, unneceſſitated act, at leaſt as to ſome kind of acts as to the means of Grace. Nor may ſuch a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary acting in the ſtrength of God's Grace, give him any ground of boaſting, no more than a poor man hath cauſe to boaſt, that when a rich man offered him Gold, and moved him to receive it, yea, took him by the lame, dead hand, and brought it to receive it; he did not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pluck it from him, or by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſhew of his reluctancy againſt him, provoke him to let go his hand, and ſo to deprive himſelf of the Gift he gave him; or that after divers attempts to pluck away his hand; yet at length, through his perſwaſion, yielded it to him. Such a man might ſay, he did better than another that threw it away, or perſiſted in his obſtinacy ſo to do, but no cauſe to boaſt of himſelf, either that he hath more

Though yet that God may and doth prevent ſome with more Grace than others, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than others, yea more early, and with more abſoluteneſs of bringing off from and drawing over all oppoſitions from them than others, may, for ought I perceive, be true and truly granted, it
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:32635:237"/>being at leaſt poſſible and probable, God being at liberty to diſtribute the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his Grace and gracious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he pleaſes. Yea, I conceive, we may ſee evident difference between his dealings in that reſpect with <hi>Jeremiah, John the Baptist, Paul,</hi> and ſome others, ordained by him to be choice Inſtruments in his hand for others good, and many other believers. But though that be ſo, yet that that's his ordinary, conſtant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working in all that are prevail'd with to believe, is not thereby proved or evidenced, much leſs do any of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mentioned evince it.</p>

Which if ſo, then is it not properly a Work or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather a ceaſing to operate, or a removal of his operations; as darkneſs is properly no operation, but a removal or bare abſence of the operation of the light inlightning; nor doth darkneſs operate any thing, though by occaſion thereof Creatures may operate amiſs, or operate ſomething upon themſelves, as by imagination, fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſurely ſins are more than meer privations, yea, ſins of omiſſion are not ſimply the not doing, but the omitting or willing neglect to do what ought, or when a thing ought to be done: much more are actual ſins of commiſſion, operations, entities, and beings; ſuch as the ſetting the heart upon covetuouſneſs, loving the World; in
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:32635:238"/>which is not only a privation of the love of God, but a poſition of the affections due to God upon the World; and ſo in Adultery, Murther, Blaſphemy, which if they be not operations poſitively, than are there no workers of iniquity, much leſs can God be the worker or operator of them: but not to inſiſt upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of a thing ſo openly repugnant to the Scriptures, and to Senſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and of ſo great a Blaſphemy, as the making God the Author and Worker of thoſe things the workers where of he hates: which affection, or diſaffection rather, is not imaginably poſſible to be in him towards himſelf, as it muſt needs be, if he be a worker; yea, the great worker of them all, in all Men and Devils too; he working all their workings of them, as that Blaſphemy, abominable to be conceived or uttered, implies. The foreſaid paſſage ſpeaks evidently of the workings of God in all the Members of Chriſt, who are therefore afterward compared to the natural body, animated and acted by one ſpirit of life; and it ſpeaks of the ſpiritual operations in them all, that they are wrought of God, and not of operations ſinful and Diabolical, though if we do carry it to all natural and animal operations, rightly, ſimply, and as regularly ſuch, it may truly alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo far in a ſober ſenſe, that they are wrougth by and in the ſtrength, power and motion given them of him;
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:32635:239"/>yet ſo as that they are either natural or voluntary operations of the creatures too, according to the natures that he hath given them; and as touching voluntary operations are ſuch and ſo upon the will of the rational creature, as not to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate its action, or diveſt it of the power he hath given it and preſerves in it, for chuſing or refuſing freely, objects propounded to it, without his neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its determination: ſo as that it's commendable in its choice, and faulty in its refuſal of ſuch good objects as are propounded to its choice and election. But I ſhall proceed no further in this Diſcourſe about God's Operations.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of it is, That all the good that is wrought in us, it is of God, in and by ſuch means and ways as he pleaſes to afford us, and in ſuch a way as ſeems good to him and to the counſel of his own will; yea, and all the good wrought by us, it is of and in and from him, yet ſo as we are therein acters with and under him; free and voluntary agents. And all the evil wrought in us is of Sathan and our own Wills, contrary to the approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or likement of God, though not without his ſufferance, which his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is alſo approved by him: and ſo we may ſay of all the evil wrought or acted by us; yea, and that oft-times he doth not only ſuffer men to do evil, and and to have evil things wrought in them; but alſo doth wiſely and holily deliver or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:32635:239"/>yield up men to Sathan and their own Luſts, either in part for their own corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and others admonition, or elſe wholly to their own deſtruction and other mens warning. And laſtly, That the good he worketh in us, he worketh it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, according to his good pleaſure, both as to means and power exerciſed with and by the means for working it, as hath more largely been explicated; ſo as in many he certainly and effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh their hearts to believe in him and abide with him in the Faith, when others are not ſo overcome by his Grace; yet ſo as he neither offers violence or force to the wills of the one, nor is defective or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other; but that as the ſalvation of the one is of him in a way of their willing and free obedience, ſo the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the other is of themſelves, in, and as the juſt reward of, their own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, unneceſſitated diſobedience.</p>

                  <p>From what we have ſaid about this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and the ſeveral Branches of it, we ſhall lay down theſe following Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Truth of the Goſpel, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Object of Faith praedicable to all men, is not to be meaſured or judged of by the diverſity of the Diſpenſations of it, and operations or things effected with or by it; or of the purpoſes of God for ſuch diſpenſing it, and working with and by it: or thought there be difference, as to manner or meaſure or both in them, yet the Doctrine in it ſelf is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as to the Object or Medicine prepared for men and the fulneſs in him the ſame for all men; and ſo is God's love in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring him one the ſame: ſo as no ground
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:32635:240"/>for queſtioning of, or much leſs conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt God's love to all, or the object or remedy being for all, becauſe all have not the ſame diſpenſations and operations therethrough afforded them. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some that have no diſpenſations of revelation here of it, nor any operation diſcernable to, or affirmable by us, may be and ſhall be ſaved by vertue of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Medicine prepared for them, <hi>as Infants dying in their infancy,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.29, 30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. and I think no body will conclude Idioliſm or Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Cradle, a ſign of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather, that where Chriſt ſpeaks nothing to men, or doth nothing amongſt them, he will not impute ſin to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22, 24. though yet he may do more to thoſe kind of perſons than we wot on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If ſome that have none, than much more ſuch as have leſs diſpenſation and operation than others may be ſaved; even when they that have much more, abuſing them, ſhall periſh, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>If the umcircumciſed do by nature,</hi> (that is, without added inſtruſtion from the Law) <hi>the things contained in the Law,</hi> (the Doctrine of God) <hi>ſhall not his uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion be counted circumciſion?</hi> And on the contrary, the man to whom more was purpoſed and diſpenſed, both for means and operations in the means, breaking the Law, (not obeying and yielding up
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:32635:241"/>to theſe more inſtructions and operations) his more ſhall not profit him, but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his condemnation; for God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (have he more or leſs diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or operations) ſhall be accepted of him. His diſtributions may be unequal or not alike, and yet he deals equally and according to one rule in his Retributions, reſpecting or accepting men, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they had or received from him and he did to and in them, but according to their receipt and improvement of what he gave them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25, 26, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Many firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt. Many firſt in means, leaſt in their acceptance of Gods grace in and through thoſe means, and ſo by conſequence, in Gods gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. And many laſt or leaſt in means, firſt in acceptance both of the grace of God in their hearts, and ſo in their being accepted of and by God in their perſons. A Prophet is not without honour, but in his own Country, where they may have moſt of him. <hi>Naaman</hi> ſeeks out and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> though a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him, and was healed by him; and the poor Widow of <hi>Zarepta</hi> believes and entertains <hi>Eliah</hi> as a man of God, and was ſuſtained ſhe and her family by him, when the generality of the Leapers and Widows of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſcarce regarded them: the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> will often hear acceptably, what the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:32635:241"/>
                     <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom the ſalvation of God was firſt and chiefly ſent, reject and make nothing of, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.30. and 20.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diverſities of diſpenſation and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2.</note> and ſo of purpoſe for diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are divers teſtifications of the ſame love that wrought in God, to prepare the object or remedy therein teſtified of. Some do more fully and eminently teſtifie it than others, and the fuller do more abundantly priviledge, honour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to obedience thoſe to whom they are vouchſafed, than the leſs do; yet that diverſity claſhes not with, but diverſly flows from and teſtifies to the univerſality of the love and grace of God, even the ſame grace that the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (the object of Faith mediately) ſpeaks forth unto men; yet ſo as thoſe that have the fuller means of the teſtification of that grace may be ſaid to be more loved and honoured (as well as (yea therefore) more engaged to Faith and Obedience) as to the ſtreamings forth of that love, and thereby vouchſafement of advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for ſalvation, than other men. As God's peculiar purpoſes to <hi>Jacob, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and <hi>John Baptist,</hi> yea and to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the vouchſafements according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given them, argued them more loved than other people to whom ſuch vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafements were not given, not as love ſignifies either God's approvement of them
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:32635:242"/>in their perſonal conſideration in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or proviſion of a remedy for them as falled, or good will to ſave them more than others in their ſubmiſſion to him; but as to the giving forth more clear demonſtrations of his love and therein choicer honour, and means to be brought to know and ſubmit to him, and to be inſtruments of bringing in others thereto alſo,
